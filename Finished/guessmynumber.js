/*
You are going to try to build a Guess My Number game with JavaScript

----------

The essence of this game is that computer randomly guesses some number and a player 
// has to guess it with limited number of guesses. 

----------
Requirements:
- game should generate a random number in a given range (1-100, for example)
- player should be told the range of possible numbers and how many guesses they have
- game should display a prompt with input field for a number
- after each guess game should tell:
- number is too big (if the number from user is greater than the guessed number)
- number is too small (if the number is smaller than the guessed number)
- If player could guess the number than the game should give a message about that and 
  render text/image confirming the win
- if player couldnâ€™t guess the number with given amount of guesses then the game stops 
  and tells the number which was guessed
